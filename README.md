# Uber-Trips-Analysis-

This Uber trips analysis project involves exploring and analyzing a dataset of Uber ride details to uncover key patterns and trends. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization techniques, the project aims to understand factors influencing trip duration, popular pickup locations, and peak travel times.

Steps involved are as follows:

1.	Data Collection: Obtained a dataset from Kaggle containing Uber trip details, stored in a CSV file (uber_trips.csv).
   
2.	Data Loading: Loaded the dataset into a Python environment using pandas, facilitating easy data manipulation and analysis.
   
3.	Data Exploration: Explored the dataset to understand its structure, identifying columns and their types, and checking for any missing values.
   
4.	Data Cleaning: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring data consistency, such as converting date columns to datetime format.
   
5.	Feature Engineering: Engineered new features from the dataset, such as extracting hour of the day and calculating trip duration from pickup and dropoff times.
   
6.	Data Visualization: Visualized data using plots (e.g., histograms, bar charts) to identify patterns in trip durations and distributions across different time periods (hourly, daily).
   
7.	Statistical Analysis: Conducted statistical analyses to uncover insights, such as average trip durations by hour of the day, helping to understand variations over time.
   
8.	Advanced Analysis: Applied advanced techniques like clustering (e.g., KMeans) to group trips based on pickup locations, and potentially used predictive modeling (e.g., Random Forest) to forecast trip durations based on historical data.

Conclusion:  The analysis of Uber trip data revealed valuable insights into travel patterns and behaviors. By examining factors such as trip durations, pickup locations, and peak times, we gained a clearer understanding of user preferences and service demands. The findings from statistical analysis and visualizations provided actionable information for optimizing operational strategies, potentially improving service efficiency and customer satisfaction.
